My journey into coding began when I discovered the transformative power of code with a simple tweak to my WordPress blog's appearance using what initially seemed like a jumble of characters. From there, I progressed from tinkering with StackOverflow solutions to piecing together various WordPress plugins to craft comprehensive web applications.

During a pivotal investment interview with 'Startup Wise Guys,' a question resonated deeply: 'Why rely on a patchwork of plugins for an MVP when you could learn to code?' This inquiry sparked a fundamental shift in my perspective, leading me to recognize the importance of technical proficiency.

Since then, fueled by a passion for innovation and armed with a dedication to mastering coding intricacies, I've been committed to creating robust, tailor-made solutions from the ground up.
